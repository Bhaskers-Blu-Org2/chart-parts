## Interfaces

__Package__: [_@markable/interfaces_](/apidocs/client/interfaces/index.html)

The key typescript interface that are used in Markable are defined in the [_@markable/interfaces_](/apidocs/client/interfaces/index.html) project. These contain enumerations for potential mark values, virtual-dom specification, and other useful definitions. If you're using TypeScript, you may need to import types from this package in addition to either the [_SceneBuilder_](/apidocs/client/builder/index.html) or [_React_](/apidocs/client/react/index.html) APIs.
