## Interfaces

__Package__: [_@gog/interfaces_](/apidocs/client/interfaces/index.html)

The key typescript interface that compose the GoG system are defined in the [_@gog/interfaces_](/apidocs/client/interfaces/index.html) project. These contain enumerations for potential mark values, virtual-dom specification, and other useful definitions. If you're using TypeScript, you may need to import types from this package in addition to either the [_SceneBuilder_](/apidocs/client/builder/index.html) or [_React_](/apidocs/client/react/index.html) APIs.
